# Namecheap config

A backup of the config files that I'm using when I'm SSH'd into my hosting.

This covers:

- **Vim (7.4):** The ubiquitous text editor
- **Bash (4.1.2):** The shell
- **Screen (4.0.03):** A terminal multiplexer. Multiple shells, persistent sessions

There will also be some notes, these may be based on my settings so don't expect these to work elsewhere.
